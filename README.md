# OOP Using Vehicles to make Planes and Cars

### description

I had to make a vehicle class with the characteristics 'passengers' and 'cargo size',
and give methods for accelerate and brake.
I then had to create 2 subclasses, called plane and car with its own methods and characteristics.

### explain what methods are available (separation of concerns)

Methods are functions that belong to a specific data type.
We used accelerate and breaking for vehicles,
park and honk for cars,
and takeoff and touchdown for planes.
Each have their own results, and can be altered for each different vehicle/car/plane.
